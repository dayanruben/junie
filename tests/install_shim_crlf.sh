# Regression test for JUNIE-3256: the Windows shim (`junie.bat`) must be written
# with CRLF line endings. cmd.exe `goto`/`call` label seeking is unreliable on
# LF-only files (e.g. the forward jump to :after_channel_oneshot), which caused
# "The system cannot find the batch label specified - after_channel_oneshot" on
# launch.
#
# The shim template in this repo is maintained with LF, so each generated
# install*.ps1 MUST normalize $SHIM_CONTENT to CRLF immediately before writing
# it to disk. This test asserts that, for every Windows installer, the CRLF
# normalization appears and precedes the WriteAllText that creates the shim.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/install_shim_crlf.sh
